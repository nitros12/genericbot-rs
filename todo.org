** TODO Fix memory leak
- Might be caused by the cache lock being taken and not released?
- Might be timing related, appears when debugged but not elsewhere.
** TODO Translate all context data unlocks into with-data calls                                    :memleak:
- Hopefully will prevent deadlocks (assuming they're our problem)
